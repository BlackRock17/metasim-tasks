2.1 Transformer Architectures


The introduction of the Transformer model [Vaswani et al., 2017]
revolutionized sequence modeling. Key innovations include:


Self-Attention Mechanism:
The self-attention mechanism allows models to capture long-range
dependencies more effectively than previous architectures.


Positional Encoding:
Since transformers lack inherent sequential inductive bias,
positional encodings provide necessary positional information.


2.2 Large Language Models


Recent developments in large language models have demonstrated
unprecedented capabilities:


GPT Series:
- GPT-1 (117M parameters) - Initial demonstration
- GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) - Scaled performance  
- GPT-3 (175B parameters) - Emergent abilities
- GPT-4 (Estimated 1T+ parameters) - Multimodal capabilities

BERT and Variants:
===============================================================
Journal of Advanced ML Research - Page 4 of 12 - 2024
===============================================================


BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
introduced bidirectional training objectives:


Masked Language Modeling (MLM):
Randomly masks tokens and predicts them based on context.


Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):
Determines if two sentences are consecutive in original text.


Subsequent improvements include:
• RoBERTa - Optimized training procedure
• DeBERTa - Disentangled attention mechanism  
• ELECTRA - Replace token detection objective
• ALBERT - Parameter sharing and factorization

4.1 Performance Analysis


Figure 1 (See page 8) illustrates performance trends across
model sizes and architectures. Key findings include:


Scaling Laws:
Performance improvements follow predictable scaling laws
with respect to:
- Model parameters (N)
- Training data size (D)  
- Computational budget (C)


The relationship approximates: Loss ∝ N^(-α) * D^(-β) * C^(-γ)
where α ≈ 0.073, β ≈ 0.095, γ ≈ 0.057


4.2 Emergent Capabilities


Large models demonstrate qualitatively different behaviors:


Few-Shot Learning:
Models can perform tasks with minimal examples,
suggesting meta-learning capabilities.


Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
Step-by-step reasoning emerges in sufficiently large models
when prompted appropriately.


[TABLE CONTINUES ON PAGE 7]
===============================================================


In-Context Learning:
===============================================================
JMLR 2024 - Page 7 of 12 - Deep Learning for NLU Survey  
===============================================================


Models adapt to new tasks within the context window without
parameter updates. This capability scales with model size:


Performance improves logarithmically with context examples:
P(correct) = α * log(n_examples) + β


where α and β are task-dependent constants.


4.3 Limitations and Failure Cases


Despite impressive capabilities, current models exhibit:


Hallucination:
Generation of plausible but factually incorrect information.


Inconsistency:
Varying performance on semantically equivalent inputs.


Bias Amplification:
Perpetuation and amplification of training data biases.


Computational Requirements:
Prohibitive inference costs for many applications.

compromising evaluation validity.


5.4 Societal Implications


The deployment of large language models raises important
considerations:


Environmental Impact:
Training large models requires significant computational
resources and energy consumption.


Misinformation Risk:
Potential for generating convincing but false information
at scale.


Economic Disruption:
Automation of knowledge work may affect employment
in various sectors.
